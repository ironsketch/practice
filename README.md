If you want to add a random thing you made, 
make a folder for random, 
make a folder for the language used 
and name your file starting with your user name. ex "yourusername_random.cc"

ex: make a folder for search
make a folder for binary search
make a folder for the language used
submit your file with your username in the front "yourusername_binarysearch.cc"

Make sure that your code looks like this at the top:

```
/* AUTH: username https://github.com/username
 * I am new to programming. This may be terrible. I am sorry.
 *
 * This is a binary search using c++. A binary search doesn't work if your array/vector is not sorted.
 *
*/
```
